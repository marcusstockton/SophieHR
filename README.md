# Sophie HR

This project is really just my first attempt at using Docker and adding/integrating some metrics like ELK logging, Grafana, Redis distributed caching

Its an attempt of mine to write a website that can be used by a HR consultant to manage companies.  
Its a dotnet core 9 api connecting to a SQL Server instance via docker
