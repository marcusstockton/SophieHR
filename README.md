# Sophie HR

Some attempt at a readme file for this api ðŸ˜„

### ToDo:
- Employee
	- ~~Add End date for employees~~
	- ~~Add notes for employees - note type? Appraisal, Leaving etc~~
	- Add leave for employees - end users can book/request - managers have to approve (substract taken leave from available leave)
 
- Company
	- Add company wide option for accruing leave (1 day per month etc?)
	- Add better heirarchy for managers - managers have managers who have managers, up to the ceo etc
	- Add postcode lookup and store lat/lon to bring up a bing map in the company details page
